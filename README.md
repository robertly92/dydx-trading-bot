Privacy Policy for Haku Bot Discord Bot

Effective Date: 01/31/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Haku Bot Discord bot ("the Bot," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information from users ("you" or "your") of the Discord servers where the Bot is present.  We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.

**Information We Collect:**

The Bot may collect the following types of information:

* **Discord User ID:**  We collect your Discord User ID to identify you within the Discord server and to enable the Bot's functionality.  This is essential for the Bot to function correctly.
* **Discord Server ID:** We collect the ID of the Discord server(s) where the Bot is used. This is necessary for the Bot to operate within the correct server context.
* **Server-Specific Configuration Data:**  If the Bot offers server-specific customization features (e.g., custom commands, welcome messages, logging settings), we may store the configuration data you set for your server. This data is associated with the Server ID.
* **Command Usage Data (Optional and Customizable by Server Admins):**  Depending on the Bot's features and server settings, we *may* collect information about the commands you use. This data could include the command name, timestamps, and any arguments provided.  Server administrators typically have control over whether this data is collected.  Check your server's settings for more information.  If collected, this data is used to improve the Bot's functionality and understand user behavior.  We will *not* collect the content of messages unless explicitly required for a specific feature (e.g., moderation bots analyzing reported messages) and with clear notification within the server.
* **Aggregated and Anonymized Data:** We may collect aggregated and anonymized data derived from the information described above.  This data will not be linked to individual users and is used for statistical analysis and to improve the Bot's performance.

**How We Use Your Information:**

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

* **Providing Bot Functionality:**  The primary purpose of collecting your information is to enable the Bot to function as intended within your Discord server.
* **Improving the Bot:**  We may use aggregated and anonymized data to analyze user behavior and identify areas for improvement in the Bot's functionality and performance.
* **Server Administration:**  Server administrators may have access to some of the collected data (e.g., server-specific configuration, command usage data if enabled) to manage and configure the Bot within their server.
* **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose your information if required by law or legal process.

**Data Sharing:**

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share your information with the following categories of recipients:

* **Server Administrators:** As mentioned above, server administrators may have access to certain data related to their server's use of the Bot.
* **Service Providers:** We may engage third-party service providers to assist with the Bot's operation (e.g., hosting, data storage).  These providers will be contractually obligated to protect your information.
* **Legal Authorities:** We may disclose your information to legal authorities if required by law or legal process.

**Data Retention:**

We will retain your information only for as long as necessary to provide the Bot's functionality and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  Server-specific configuration data is typically retained until the server disables the related feature or removes the Bot. Command usage data (if collected) may be retained for a specific period and then deleted or anonymized.

**Your Choices:**

* **Server Administrators:** Server administrators have control over certain data collection settings within their server.  You should contact your server administrator for information about these settings.
* **Leaving the Server:** If you leave a Discord server where the Bot is present, the Bot will no longer collect new data about you within that server. However, data collected prior to you leaving may be retained as described in the Data Retention section.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy:**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy within the Bot's support server (if applicable) or through other appropriate means.
